### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
    
  * *E.g., Be open to opinions that differ from your own, actively ask for
      opinions from each member of the team, do not interrupt each other, don’t
      place blame, all suggestions or questions are encouraged, listened to,
      considered equally, and never judged*
    * Openness to new ideas - "No bad ideas"
    * Open to sharing and listening about stress levels/mental state
  

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
    
  * *E.g., communicate when there is a misunderstanding, don’t move forward
      until the situation is resolved, directly address and resolve negativity,
      give and receive feedback with a positive, strength-building mindset, if
      necessary, escalate to a BloomTech staff member*  
    * Be proactive about a positive attitude
    * Remember that we all have the same goals, and we can work through the challenges together

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
     
  * *E.g., estimate task size, break down large tasks, call out tasks at risk
       early, ask each other for help, how to ensure timely code reviews, how to
       share knowledge, help each other hold accountability give frequent,
       scheduled updates*  
    * Communicate on task status - whether ahead or behind, etc.
    * Daily check-ins
    * Communicate on task status - whether ahead or behind, etc.
    

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
  * *E.g., acknowledge, but don’t punish slipped dates, figure out what went
         wrong, identify lessons for future*
  

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?** 
  * *E.g., where to track goals and when to review them, use definitive,
       quantifiable terminology, include clear background on why this goal is
       necessary, include “done” criteria for the goal (code is pushed with
       integration tests, document is reviewed, etc.)*
