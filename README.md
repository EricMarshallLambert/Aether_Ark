> This service will allow a user to create their own solar system. The user can input values for each celestial body they want to create, and will be shown a visual representation of the system that they make. Celestial objects will be made separately and then added or removed from a solar system.


>This service was part of group project while enrolled at BloomTech's Backend Web Development program.
